# FluxPath Installer

FluxPath is the next-generation MMU intelligence layer for Klipper — a modular, extensible, AI‑inspired platform designed to unify backend logic, UI panels, and hardware orchestration into a single cohesive system.

This repository contains the full FluxPath installer suite, including:

- Interactive installer
- Auto mode
- Dry-run mode
- Uninstall
- Repair
- Doctor (diagnostics)
- Snapshots
- Backups
- Version stamping
- UI panel scaffolding (Fluidd + Mainsail)
- Backend scaffolding

FluxPath is currently in early development (v0.1.0‑dev), but the installer is fully functional and ready for real-world use.
